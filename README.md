OpenEaagles (now called MIXR, for "the Mixed Reality Simulation Platform") is a "multi-platform simulation platform designed to help engineers and software developers rapidly prototype and build robust, scalable, virtual and constructive, and stand-alone and distributed simulation applications". The Bede BD-5 Micro is a series of small, single-seat homebuilt aircraf. The BD-5 has a small, streamlined fuselage holding its semi-reclined pilot under a large canopy, with the engine installed in a compartment in the middle of the fuselage, and a propeller-driving engine – or jet engine in the BD-5J variant – mounted immediately to the rear of the cockpit. Aviation Technology Group (ATG) was an american aerospace company, the developer of the ATG Javelin very light jet (VLJ). The Boom XB-1 "Baby Boom" is a retired trijet supersonic demonstrator designed by Boom Technology as part of the development of the Boom Overture supersonic transport airliner. It should be the first variant of a family of modular aircraft reconfigurable to cover various roles, such as operational training, basic jet training, aerobatics/display and light combat. It features a unique wing architecture that enhances maneuverability and transonic capability. The directory structure includes a specific folder for each phase of development and engineering programs:

CAD: For computer-aided design.
CAM: Dedicated to the part manufacturing and assembly process.
CAS: For simulation of end-to-end functionality and performance analysis.
