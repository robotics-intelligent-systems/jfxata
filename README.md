# Modular Aircraft Reconfigurable

An amphibious aircraft, or amphibian, is an aircraft that can take off and land on both solid ground and water. MakerPlane is a volunteer-driven open-source aviation organization focused on making affordable avionics and resources more accessible to the experimental aviation community. Engineering Design Handbook. Helicopter Engineering. Preliminary design, detail design, qualification assurance and performance testing. A FreeCAD workbench dedicated to Airplane Design. OpenEaagles (now called MIXR, for "the Mixed Reality Simulation Platform") is a "multi-platform simulation platform designed to help engineers and software developers rapidly prototype and build robust, scalable, virtual and constructive, and stand-alone and distributed simulation applications". TRANsient Simulation Framework of Reconfigurable Models. Saab Aeronautics has chosen Modelica and Dymola as part of the means for modelo based system engineering (MBSE). A Dymola library for modeling thermal hydraulic energy systems and other multi-physics systems. The Rotorcraft Aerodynamics Library is a Modelica library for supporting the analysis and design of current and future rotorcraft. HanserModelica is a Modelica open source educational library on object oriented modeling applied to electrical engineering and a particular focus on polyphase electric machines. The Bede BD-5 Micro is a series of small, single-seat homebuilt aircraft. The BD-5 has a small, streamlined fuselage holding its semi-reclined pilot under a large canopy, with the engine installed in a compartment in the middle of the fuselage, and a propeller-driving engine – or jet engine in the BD-5J variant – mounted immediately to the rear of the cockpit. The directory structure includes a specific folder for each phase of development and engineering programs:

CAD: For computer-aided design.
CAM: Dedicated to the part manufacturing and assembly process.
CAS: For simulation of end-to-end functionality and performance analysis.
